Git manages all the modifications.After using "git add",
your modification will be put into stage.
And "git commit" is just responsible for submitting
all the modifications in the stage.

If you wanna check the difference between the file in
working directory and the file in the latest stage,
use the command,
$ git diff HEAD -- something
(something is a some specific file)

If you don't add, you can't commit.

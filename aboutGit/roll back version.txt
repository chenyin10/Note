Git uses commit_id to record all the changes of version.
To check your git record, use the command ,
$ git log --pretty=oneline

In Git, HEAD means the current version, and HEAD^ means the last version.
We can also use HEAD^100 to express last 100 version.
To roll back last version, we can use command,
$ git reset --hard HEAD^

we can use the commit_id to roll back.Suppose some version's commit_id is 3268164....,
we can roll back by using the command,
$ git reset --hard 3268164

Git provides a command recording all the commands you have done, 
$ git reflog
You can know the commit_id which has been eliminated because of your using reset.

Working directory is the directory 
you can see on computer.
For an example, learngit.

There is a hidden directory in working directory,
name of which is ".git".
It's the repository of Git.
There are a lot of things stored in repository of Git.
The most important things in it is index, first branch 
Git created for us named "master", and a pointer pointing 
to master named "HEAD".

The command "git add" actually adds the file to stage(index).
And the command "git commit" submits all content in stage to current branch.

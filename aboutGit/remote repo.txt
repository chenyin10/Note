You can actually set up a server running Git, 
but in current stage, it's just making a fuss
to set up a server just for learning git.

GitHub provides services of Git repository management.
You can get remote Git repository for free as long as 
you register a account.

The transmission between your local git repository and
GitHub repository is cryptographic by SSH.

Why GitHub needs SSH? Because it needs to know
the truth that you do push your submission.

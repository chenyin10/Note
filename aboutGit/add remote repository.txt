First you need to create repository in GitHub.
To associate with a remote repository,
use command,
$ git remote add origin git@server-name:path/repo-name.git

After adding, the default name of the remote repository is origin.

To push your local repository to GitHub,
use command,
$ git push origin master
(For the first time, use "git push -u origin master",
which not only push but also associates with remote repository)

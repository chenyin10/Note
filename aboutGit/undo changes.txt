Before "git add" :
To give up the modification in working directory,
use the command,
$ git checkout -- file
If without "--", the command turns to create a new branch.

After "git add" but before "git commit" :
To unstage, use the command,
$ git reset HEAD file
The command "git reset" can both roll back version
and give up all the modifications submitted to stage.

Look up "roll back version" chapter.

The main branch is called master in Git.
Master points to the latest commitment, and HEAD
points to current branch.
After each commitment, the master moves one step.

Create dev branch :
$ git checkout -b dev
(with "-b" means create and switch to)
$ git branch dev
$ git checkout dev

To check current branch,
use commmand,
$ git branch

After adding some files in dev, 
you can switch to master by using command,
$ git checkout master

Now we can merge what have done on dev to master
by using command,
$ git merge dev 

After having merged, you can delete dev
by using command,
$ git branch -d dev
